# Product Requirements Document (PRD)

## Project Overview

This PRD documents the Style Guide Boilerplate project - a comprehensive Next.js starter template with integrated documentation system, task management, and modern development tooling. This project serves as a "create-react-app" style boilerplate for new projects within the Sirius ecosystem.

**Project Name**: Style Guide Boilerplate

### Functional Requirements

1. **Documentation System**
   - YAML front matter for machine-readable metadata
   - Template-based documentation structure
   - Developer guides for common patterns
   - LLM-optimized content structure
   - **Acceptance Criteria**: All documentation follows template structure, includes front matter, and is discoverable via documentation index

2. **Task Management System**
   - JSON Schema-compliant task files
   - Task status tracking (pending, in_progress, completed, blocked)
   - Dependency management between tasks
   - Task validation script
   - **Acceptance Criteria**: Tasks can be validated, dependencies are enforced, status updates work correctly

3. **Component Library Foundation**
   - ShadCN UI components integrated
   - Custom layout components (AppLayout, PageLayout, ContentSection, GridLayout)
   - Loading components (ActiveConstellationV2Loader)
   - Consistent styling with Tailwind CSS
   - **Acceptance Criteria**: All components follow design system patterns, are properly typed, and documented

4. **API Development**
   - tRPC setup with type-safe client/server
   - Example routers demonstrating patterns
   - Input validation with Zod
   - Error handling patterns
   - **Acceptance Criteria**: tRPC endpoints are type-safe, validated, and handle errors gracefully

5. **Database Integration**
   - Drizzle ORM configured
   - Multi-provider support (SQLite, PostgreSQL, MySQL)
   - Migration workflow
   - Schema definition examples
   - **Acceptance Criteria**: Database can be configured for any provider, migrations work correctly, schema is type-safe

6. **Developer Experience**
   - Comprehensive guides for common tasks
   - Code organization patterns
   - TypeScript patterns and conventions
   - Styling conventions
   - **Acceptance Criteria**: Developers can follow guides to implement features consistently

### Non-Functional Requirements

- **Performance**: 
  - Page load time < 2 seconds
  - Lighthouse performance score > 90
  - Optimized bundle size

- **Security**: 
  - Input validation on all API endpoints
  - Secure environment variable handling
  - No sensitive data in client-side code

- **Scalability**: 
  - Support for multiple database providers
  - Modular architecture for easy extension
  - Component-based structure for reusability

- **Accessibility**: 
  - WCAG 2.1 AA compliance
  - Keyboard navigation support
  - Screen reader compatibility

- **Browser Support**: 
  - Modern browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge)
  - Last 2 versions of each browser

## Success Criteria

- [x] Next.js application builds and runs successfully
- [x] Documentation system is functional and comprehensive
- [x] Task management system validates and tracks tasks correctly
- [x] Component library foundation is established
- [x] tRPC API development patterns are documented and working
- [x] Database integration supports multiple providers
- [x] Developer guides cover all common development patterns
- [x] CI/CD workflows run successfully
- [x] Application deploys to Vercel successfully
- [x] Code follows TypeScript and React best practices

## Timeline

- **Phase 1**: Project Setup and Foundation (Completed)
  - Initialize Next.js project
  - Set up development environment
  - Configure tooling (TypeScript, ESLint, Prettier)
  - Set up CI/CD workflows

- **Phase 2**: Core Features Implementation (Completed)
  - Implement documentation system
  - Build task management system
  - Create component library foundation
  - Set up tRPC and database integration

- **Phase 3**: Developer Experience (Completed)
  - Create comprehensive developer guides
  - Document patterns and conventions
  - Update template project with real-world examples
  - Organize documentation structure

- **Phase 4**: Deployment and Finalization (Completed)
  - Deploy to Vercel
  - Final documentation review
  - Code cleanup and optimization
  - Project handoff documentation

## Dependencies

### External Services

- **Vercel**: Hosting and deployment platform
- **GitHub**: Version control and CI/CD
- **npm**: Package management

### Assumptions

- Developers are familiar with TypeScript and React
- Node.js 20+ is available
- Git is installed and configured
- Vercel account is available for deployment

### Constraints

- Must work with Next.js 16 App Router
- Must support SQLite, PostgreSQL, and MySQL databases
- Must follow Sirius design system patterns
- Documentation must be LLM-optimized

## Risks

- **Risk 1**: Documentation becomes outdated as code evolves
  - **Mitigation**: Automated documentation updates via CI workflows, regular review cycles

- **Risk 2**: Component library grows inconsistently
  - **Mitigation**: Establish clear component patterns and review process

- **Risk 3**: Task management system becomes complex
  - **Mitigation**: Keep task structure simple, provide clear examples

## Lessons Learned

### What Worked Well

1. **Documentation Structure**: Organizing docs into guides/ and development/ directories improved discoverability
2. **TypeScript Patterns**: Establishing clear patterns early prevented inconsistencies
3. **Component Organization**: Feature-based component organization made code easier to navigate
4. **Real-World Examples**: Using actual project examples in templates made them more useful

### What Could Be Improved

1. **Initial Setup**: Could benefit from more detailed setup instructions
2. **Testing**: Could add more comprehensive testing examples
3. **Performance**: Could optimize bundle size further

### Recommendations for Future Projects

1. Start with documentation structure early
2. Establish patterns before building features
3. Use real-world examples in templates
4. Keep documentation organized and discoverable
5. Automate documentation updates when possible

## Notes

This PRD documents the actual Style Guide Boilerplate project that was built. It serves as a template showing how a real project PRD should be structured, with concrete examples based on actual implementation.

The project successfully achieved all objectives and provides a solid foundation for new projects within the Sirius ecosystem.
