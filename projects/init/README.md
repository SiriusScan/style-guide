# Init Project Reference

This directory contains reference materials and examples for the init project setup process.

## Contents

- **plans/**: Project planning examples
- **resources/**: Resource organization examples
- **tasks/**: Task management examples
- **README.md**: This file

## Note

The actual Next.js application code has been moved to the root `style-guide/` directory. This directory now serves as a reference for:

- How to structure project planning documents
- How to organize project resources
- How to create task management files
- Example project structure

## Using This as Reference

When creating a new project from this boilerplate:

1. Copy the entire `style-guide/` repository (not just this directory)
2. Use the examples in `projects/template-project/` and this directory as references
3. Follow the migration guide: `docs/development/GUIDE.using-boilerplate.md`

_This directory is for reference only. The actual application code is in the root directory._
