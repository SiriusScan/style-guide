# UI Components

This directory contains ShadCN UI components and custom UI components.

## ShadCN UI Components

Components from ShadCN UI will be added here when installed via:

```bash
npx shadcn-ui@latest add [component-name]
```

## Custom Components

Project-specific custom components should be placed in `components/` directory (not in `ui/`).

## Component Library

The component library will be populated by a separate development team. Components will be integrated into an overview page for documentation and testing.

---

_This directory structure is ready for component library integration._
